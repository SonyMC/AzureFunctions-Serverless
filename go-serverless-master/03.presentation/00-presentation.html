# Go Serverless
# in AWS & Azure
---
## AWS Serverless Architecture
![](./images/aws/05-serverless-course/aws-serverless-full-stack.png)
---
## Azure Serverless Architecture
![](./images/aws/05-serverless-course/azure-serverless-full-stack.png)

---
## Before the Cloud
![](./images/load-variations.png) 
- Consider a Online Shopping Application: 
	- Peak usage during holidays and weekends. Less load during rest of the time.
- A startup suddenly becomes popular:
	- How does it handle the **sudden increase** in load?
- Enterprises **procured** (bought) infrastructure **for peak load**
	- Startups procured infrastructure assuming they would be successful
---
## Before the Cloud - Challenges
![](./images/load-variations.png)
- Low infrastructure utilization
- Needs ahead of time planning (**Can you guess the future?**)
- High costs of procuring infrastructure
- Dedicated infrastructure maintenance team (**Can a startup afford it?**)

---
<!-- .slide: class="one30 image-right image-twenty" -->
## Silver Lining in the Cloud
![](./images/cloud.png) 
- How about **provisioning (renting) resources** when you want them and releasing them back when you do not need them? 
	- **On-demand resource provisioning**
- Advantages
	- Lower costs (Pay per use)
	- No upfront planning needed
	- Avoid **"undifferentiated heavy lifting"**
- Challenge
	- Building cloud enabled applications

---
## Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
<!-- .slide: class="one30 image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/aws.png)
- Leading cloud service provider
- Provides most (200+) services
- Reliable, secure and cost-effective

---
## Serverless
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambda.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/dynamodb.png) 
- What are the things we think about when we develop an application?
	- Where do we deploy the application?
	- What kind of server? What OS?
	- How do we take care of scaling the application?
	- How do we ensure that it is always available?
- **What if we do not need to worry about servers and focus on building our application?**
- Enter **Serverless**

---
## Serverless
- Remember: **Serverless does NOT mean "No Servers"**
- **Serverless for me**:
	- You don't worry about infrastructure
	- Flexible scaling
	- Automated high availability
	- Pay for use:
		- You don't have to provision servers or capacity!
- **You focus on code** and the cloud managed service takes care of all that is needed to scale your code to serve millions of requests!

---
## AWS Lambda
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambda.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambdafunction.png) 
- Write and Scale Your Business Logic
	- Write your business logic in Node.js (JavaScript), Java, Python, Go,  C# and more..
	- Don't worry about servers or scaling or availability (only worry about your code)
- Pay for Use
	- Number of requests
	- Duration of requests
	- Memory

---
## Lambda Function Concurrency
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-ten" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambda.png) 
- **Function concurrency** - no of Lambda function instances serving requests (at a given time)
- You invoke a lambda function for the first time:
	- AWS Lambda creates an instance of the function
	- AWS Lambda runs the function's handler method and returns  the response
	- (However) The function instance stays active and waits to process new events
- You invoke the lambda fn again (while first event is in progress):
	- AWS Lambda creates another instance of the function
- When no of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances
- (However) There are limits to concurrency of lambda function (DEMO)
- Provisioned concurrency can help to avoid fluctuations in latency (DEMO)

---
## REST API Challenges
![](./images/aws/00-icons/user.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambdafunction.png) 

- Most applications today are built around REST API:
	- Resources (/todos, /todos/{id}, etc.)
	- Actions - HTTP Methods - GET, PUT, POST, DELETE etc.
- Management of REST API is not easy:
	- You've to take care of authentication and authorization
	- You've to be able to set limits (rate limiting, quotas) for your API consumers
	- You've to take care of implementing multiple versions of your API
	- You would want to implement monitoring, caching and a lot of other features..

---
## Amazon API Gateway
![](./images/aws/00-icons/user.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambdafunction.png) 
- How about a **fully managed service** with auto scaling that can act as a **"front door"** to your APIs?
- Welcome **"Amazon API Gateway"**

---
## Amazon API Gateway
![](./images/aws/00-icons/user.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png)
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambdafunction.png) 

- **"publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale"**
- Integrates with AWS Lambda or any web application
- Supports HTTP(S) and WebSockets (two way communication - chat apps and streaming dashboards)
- Serverless. **Pay for use** (API calls and connection duration)

---
## API Gateway - API Types
<!-- .slide: class="one30 image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png) 
- **REST API** 
	- feature-rich RESTful API
- **HTTP API**
	- Also used to build RESTful API
	- Newer approach
- **WebSocket API**
	- Persistent connections with clients 
	- Allows full-duplex communication
- Names are little confusing

---
## API Gateway RESTful API approaches
<!-- .slide: class="ninety" -->

![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png) 
![](./images/arrow.png) 
![](./images/aws/00-icons/lambdafunction.png) 

##### REST API
- Fully Featured (API caching, Request/Response Validations, Test invocations)
- Custom Request/Response Transformations
- Better Integration with AWS Services (AWS X-Ray, AWS WAF etc)

##### HTTP API
- Newer, Simpler, Cheaper and Low Latency
- Automatic Deployments

---
## REST API Gateway - Custom Integration (Default)
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-fifty" -->
![](./images/aws/05-serverless-course/api-gateway-custom-integration.png)
- Integrations define request/response transformation to/from lambda
- The default is Custom Integration
- Request can be transformed by configuring Mapping Template in Integration Request
- Response can be transformed by configuring Mapping Template in Integration Response

---
## REST API Gateway - Proxy Integration
![](./images/aws/05-serverless-course/api-gateway-proxy-integration.png)
- How about defining a standard transformation?

---
## REST API Gateway - Proxy Integration - Request

##### Request to API Gateway
```
//Headers: header1:header-value
//queryString: ?queryparam=queryparamvalue
{
	"message": "Welcome"
}
```

##### Standard event sent to Lambda Function
```
{
	resource: '/todos',
	path: '/todos',
	httpMethod: 'POST',
	headers: {"header1":"header-value"},
	multiValueHeaders: {"header1":["header-value"]},
	queryStringParameters: {"queryparam":"queryparamvalue"},
	multiValueQueryStringParameters: {"queryparam":["queryparamvalue"]},
	pathParameters: null,
	stageVariables: null,
	requestContext: {},
	body: '{\n  "message" : "Welcome"\n}',
	isBase64Encoded: false
}
```
---
## REST API Gateway Proxy Integration - Response

##### Response from Lambda Function
```
{
    statusCode: 200,                     // a valid HTTP status code
    headers: { 
        custom-header: "xyz"             // any API-specific custom header
    },
    body: "{\"message\": \"Welcome\"}"   // a JSON string.
}
```

##### Response from API Gateway
![](./images/aws/05-serverless-course/api-gateway-proxy-integration-response.png)

---
## HTTP API - API Gateway
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png) 

- REST API - API Gateway has a lot of features very few AWS customers made use of 
- REST API - API Gateway is a little complex to setup (transformations etc)
- How about creating a simpler API Gateway?
- Enter "HTTP API"
	- The naming is confusing
	- Newer, Cheaper and Low Latency
	- Simpler
		- Lesser features
		- Easier to setup
		- Example: Makes OAuth Authentication simple

---
## HTTP API - API Gateway - Payload
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/apigateway.png) 
- Two Versions - 1.0 and 2.0
- (Recommendation) Use 1.0 for migration from REST API and 2.0 for newer APIs
- Request Structure
	- Almost same as REST API - Proxy Integration
	- 2.0 offers support for cookies and has minor changes
- Response Structure
	- Same as REST API - Proxy Integration (with `statusCode`,`body`, `headers`)
	- In addition, 2.0 supports a simple structure:
		- Just return a valid response JSON  `return {"message": "Welcome"}`

---
## Amazon Cognito
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/cognito.png) 
- Want to quickly add a sign-up page and authentication for your mobile and web apps?
- Want to integrate with web identity providers (example: Google, Facebook, Amazon) and provide a social sign-in?
- Do you want security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), phone and email verification?
- Want to create your own user database without worrying about scaling or operations?
- Let's go : Amazon Cognito

---
## Amazon Cognito - User Pools
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/cognito.png) 
- Do you want to create your own secure and scalable user directory?
- Do you want to create sign-up pages?
- Do you want a built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users (with option to social sign-in )?
- Create a user pool

---
## Amazon Cognito - Identity pools
![](./images/aws/cognito-identity-pools.png)
- Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services
- Connect identity pools with authentication (identity) providers 
	- Your own user pool OR
	- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google+, Twitter OR
	- OpenID Connect provider OR
	- SAML identity providers (SAML 2.0)
- Configure multiple authentication (identity) providers for each identity pool
- Federated Identity 
	- An external authentication (identity) provider
	- ex: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, OpenID or SAML identity providers

---
## Amazon DynamoDB 
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/dynamodb.png) 
- Fast, scalable, distributed for any scale
- Flexible NoSQL Key-value & document database (schemaless) 
- Single-digit millisecond responses for million of TPS
- Do not worry about scaling, availability or durability
	- Automatically partitions data as it grows
	- Maintains 3 replicas within the same region
- No need to provision a database 
	- Create a table and configure read and write capacity (RCU and WCU)
	- Automatically scales to meet your RCU and WCU
- Provides an expensive serverless mode
- Use cases: User profiles, shopping carts, high volume read write applications


---
## DynamoDB Tables
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-thirty" -->
![](./images/aws/document-database-example.png)
- Hierarchy : Table > item(s) > attribute (key value pair)
- Mandatory primary key
- Other than the primary key, tables are schemaless
	- No need to define the other attributes or types
	- Each item in a table can have distinct attributes
- Max 400 KB per item in table
	- Use S3 for large objects and DynamoDB for smaller objects

---

## Simple Queuing Service
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-fifty" -->
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/2-sqs.png)
- Reliable, scalable, fully-managed message queuing service
- High availability
- Unlimited scaling
	- Auto scale to process billions of messages per day
- Low cost (Pay for use)

---
## Standard and FIFO Queues
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/sqs.png)

- Standard Queue 
	- Unlimited throughput
	- BUT NO guarantee of ordering (Best-Effort Ordering) 
	- and NO guarantee of exactly-once processing
		- Guarantees at-least-once delivery (some messages can be processed twice)
- FIFO (first-in-first-out) Queue
	- First-In-First-out Delivery
	- Exactly-Once Processing
	- BUT throughput is lower 
		- Upto 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second)
		- If you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum), up to 3,000 messages per second 
- Choose
	- Standard SQS queue if throughput is important
	- FIFO Queue if order of events is important

---
## Sending and receiving a SQS Message - Best case scenario
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-thirty" -->
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/sqs-simple-flow.png)
- Producer places message on queue 
	- Receives globally unique message ID ABCDEFGHIJ (used to track the message)
- Consumer polls for messages 
	- Receives the message ABCDEFGHIJ along with a receipt handle XYZ
- Message remains in the queue while the consumer processes the message
	- Other consumers will not receive ABCDEFGHIJ even if they poll for messages
- Consumer processes the message successfully 
	- Calls delete message (using receipt handle XYZ)
	- Message is removed from the queue

---
## Amazon Simple Notification Service(SNS)
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-forty" -->
![](./images/aws/02-Queuing/3-SNS.png)
- Publish-Subscribe (pub-sub) paradigm
- Broadcast asynchronous event notifications
- Simple process
	- Create an SNS Topic
	- Subscribers can register for a Topic
	- When an SNS Topic receives an event notification (from publisher), it is broadcast to all Subscribers
- Use Cases : Monitoring Apps, workflow systems, mobile apps

---
## Amazon Simple Notification Service(SNS)
<!-- .slide: class="image-right image-twenty" -->
![](./images/aws/00-icons/sns.png)

- Provides mobile and enterprise messaging web services
	- Push notifications to Apple, Android, FireOS, Windows devices
	- Send SMS to mobile users
	- Send Emails
- REMEMBER : SNS does not need SQS or a Queue
- You can allow access to other AWS accounts using AWS SNS generated policy
